## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Modular CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_CSS)
- [React Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

### What I learned

While building this project, I strengthened my understanding of React fundamentals and state management using Context API. Managing the shopping cart state across different components without external libraries helped me get more comfortable with context patterns.

I also learned how to organize component structure in a clean way and improve UX with conditional rendering and simple logic handling.

### Continued development

In the future, I’d like to:

- Add persistent cart state with localStorage

- Improve the styling and animations (e.g. transition when adding/removing items)

- Implement form validation on the order confirmation

- Add accessibility improvements for screen readers

### Useful resources

- React Docs - Context – helped me deeply understand how to manage global state without Redux.

- Vite Documentation – made development super fast and efficient.

- CSS Tricks - Responsive Design – helped me with responsive breakpoints.
